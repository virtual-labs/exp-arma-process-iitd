      "answers": {
        "a": "A time-limited signal has a band-limited Fourier Transform.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "The Fourier Transform of a time-limited signal is not band-limited; it spreads over all frequencies.",
        "b": "This statement is correct as the Fourier Transform of a time-limited signal typically has infinite duration.",

        "d": "It reduces the signal's bandwidth."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is incorrect; modulation does not create a band-pass effect directly.",
        "b": "Multiplying by a cosine modulates the signal, shifting its spectrum.",
